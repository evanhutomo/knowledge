# The healing process
1. Unfollow all toxic people in your life, you dont need to explain why
2. Try to stop stalking and comparing yourself to people online. You are all on different path
3. In case you get sad, its OK. Let it all out, but just dont dwell on it. It will be over soon
4. Do more of what make you happy or just busy. Keep ur mind off things that bother you
5. Reach out to people who actually care about your well-being
6. Laugh about the little (or stupid) things
