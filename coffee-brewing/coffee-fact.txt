1. Cup of Joe = 100 mg. The official caffeine content on the USDA on a cup of coffee (brewed, black) is 90-95 mg but this is heavily influenced by:

a. type of bean
b. roasting temp.
c. water used
d. brewing method

(ref: https://tinyurl.com/kpebsn6)

======

2. 400 mg a day is recommended. Perhaps this is a joke but there's officially no such thing as recommended caffeine intake. Perhaps it was taken from a survey of average intake

(ref: Minelli A, Bellezza I. Methylxanthines and reproduction. Handb Exp Pharmacol. 2011;(200):349-72.)

3. Reproductive risks. There is such a thing called "stim dick" or the inability of a man to have erections which is thought to be caused by consuming a ton of stimulants and caffeine is the most consumed stimulant in the world.

I will not contest the fact that over 1 g of stimulants can cause this but I can tell you is there have been zero studies that suggest this can happen to humans as far as plain coffee intake is concerned.

The only study I found is on rats. It also doesn't account for the fact that caffeine wears off as the day goes by so the only way a person to do this is to consume 9 cups of brewed coffee in one go and they have to do it within 5-6 hours, the half life of caffeine.

(ref: Dorostghoal M, Erfani majd N, Nooraei P. Maternal caffeine consumption has irreversible effects on reproductive parameters and fertility in male offspring rats. Clin Exp Reprod Med. 2012;39(4):144-52.)

4. Bean "toasting" process can produce cancer. Okay, this one is just plain stupid. Right now, I can literally send you over 20 studies saying coffee alone is capable of reducing cancer risk or is not associated with cancer at all and those are just within the last 10 years.

The most it can contribute to is esophageal cancer but it's not limited to coffee at all as this type of cancer is caused by daily consumption of hot liquids and that include soup and tea.

(ref: Chen Y, Tong Y, Yang C, et al. Consumption of hot beverages and foods and the risk of esophageal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies. BMC Cancer. 2015;15:449.)

As for the roasting process, to be honest I also thought burning the beans can cause cancer and it's due to acrylamide, the very compound largely found in your barbecues or grilled/burnt food.

Luckily, acrylamide doesn't seem to be a cancer-causing substance within the amounts humans normally consume.

(ref: Exon JH. A review of the toxicology of acrylamide. J Toxicol Environ Health B Crit Rev. 2006;9(5):397-412.

5. Ulcers and heartburn. These have been debunked years ago. The only thing keeping these "facts" alive are people's fears.

(ref: Shimamoto T, Yamamichi N, Kodashima S, et al. No association of coffee consumption with gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, reflux esophagitis, and non-erosive reflux disease: a cross-sectional study of 8,013 healthy subjects in Japan. PLoS ONE. 2013;8(6):e65996.

6. Dehydration. LOL okay, first of all coffee is actually largely made up of water. In fact, one cup of coffee (brewed, black) is officially listed to be made up of 99.4% water.

(ref: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/beverages/3898/2)

But let's not stop there. There's an actual study that says coffee DOES NOT cause dehydration.

(ref: Killer SC, Blannin AK, Jeukendrup AE. No evidence of dehydration with moderate daily coffee intake: a counterbalanced cross-over study in a free-living population. PLoS ONE. 2014;9(1):e84154.)

7. Increases cholesterol. Okay, this I can get behind and the cholesterol found in coffee are actually two and they are cafestol and kahweol.

Yes, brewed coffee might just increase cholesterol in your body BUT (and emphasis on the word BUTT), studies have shown three things:

a. Cholesterol is not associated with heart disease. In fact, they may even provide heart and brain health benefits.
b. Avoiding cholesterol-increasing foods can actually be fatal.
c. The cholesterol found in coffee are actually ANTI CANCER.

(ref: Berger S, Raman G, Vishwanathan R, Jacques PF, Johnson EJ. Dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Am J Clin Nutr. 2015;102(2):276-94.

8. Osteoporosis and bone health. This is another outdated "fact" which is probably based on its acidity.

Studies about this have actually concluded:

a. Coffee in moderate amounts can have bone protective benefits.
b. The populations who consume coffee and suffered osteoporosis were also a bunch of people who forgot to include calcium in their diet.
c. The most it can do (at more than four cups a day) is reduce bone density by 2% but that's easily offset by dietary calcium intake.

(ref: Hallström H, Byberg L, Glynn A, Lemming EW, Wolk A, Michaëlsson K. Long-term coffee consumption in relation to fracture risk and bone mineral density in women. Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(6):898-909.

9. Boost metabolism. Okay, this one is pretty legit but it's not so much metabolism (energy conversion) but lipolysis (fat breakdown) and thermogenesis (heat production).

I did a lot of research on it in the past to say it's true but I'll post some references anyway.

(ref: Ding W-X. Drinking Coffee Burns Hepatic Fat by Inducing Lipophagy Coupled with Mitochondrial β-Oxidation. Hepatology (Baltimore, Md). 2014;59(4):1235-1238. doi:10.1002/hep.26736.

10. Inhibits adenosine, the sleep hormone. Well, no shit. Melatonin and adenosine are two important compounds in the brain responsible for sleep and body recovery.

As we go through our day, adenosine accumulates in the body which makes us feel tired. When we sleep, the adenosine is removed so we feel energized when we wake up.

The problem is Adenosine and Caffeine share the same receptors and as frightening as this can be, this is actually REALLY NORMAL. You know, because we drink coffee TO PREVENT sleep/reduce fatigue, right?

Granted there are instances where you shouldn't overload your receptors with caffeine in place of adenosine (like a few hours before you sleep), saying caffeine inhibits adenosine = coffee prevents us from sleeping which is COMMON SENSE
